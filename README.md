# hey, what's that?

It's just a bunch of python scripts that together:
a) teaches a model to classificate emotions based on a cropped photo of face
b) swaps faces to emoticons in realtime (using video stream from a webcam)

# how can I use it?

To see it in action you need:
a) python
b) opencv
c) [dataset to teach a model, but you can used a model teached on http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/]
